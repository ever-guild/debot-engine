# DEngine

> ⚠️ This repository is no longer supported, please consider using DEngine from [TON-SDK](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/tree/master/ton_client/src/debot) instead.

DEngine is a rust library that implements debot engine and allows to run debot smart contracts.

## Example

Simple debot browser which uses DEngine can be found here `./tests/integration_test.rs`

DEngine is used by [tonos-cli](https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-cli).
Run debots in tonos-cli with the following command:

    tonos-cli debot fetch <debot_address>
